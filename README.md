# Display R notebooks on GitHub

This is the bane of my existence: https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1020

GitHub does not render this notebook: https://github.com/shntnu/gh-nbhtml/blob/main/7.deconstruct-grit.nb.html

But GitHub pages can help: https://shntnu.github.io/sandbox/7.deconstruct-grit.nb.html

For private repos, it is possible to make GitHub pages accessible to only those with access to the repo: https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site

Still, JJ's method seems so easy to implement, and I wish GH would just do it: https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1020#issuecomment-320504839
